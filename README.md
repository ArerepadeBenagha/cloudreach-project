You have been tasked by SnapVideo's CTO to build and provision a secure network infrastructure for hosting a three-tier application. It should host the frontend and backend applications alongside a database. All 3 must be in separate subnets. As an MVP, there should be one environment (development) in one specific region (Europe). Assuming the application should be accessible through HTTPS and talking to the backend on port 8080. Access to the database should only be from the backend on the default MySQL database port. The solution should demonstrate high availability in the event an application experiences failure.
